idea = viewset with crud and pagination

url: 127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/ideas-collection/.... (slug)

=========
Backend:
=========
1. mode Idea/ IdeaUserRelation
instead of annotated attr (total likes,max rating,average rating) |=> created chached fields
attr names are the same
value gets re-calculated only if like or rating has been changed
2. method .save() model IdeaUserRelation follows these changes and calls for 
aggregation of like/rating if needed

So: instead of idea qs.annotation => use model Idea cached fields that are updated
via aggregation in IdeaUserRelation model

2.viewset: 
select_related (category FK)
prefetch_related (tags m2m


result: (incl  users_comments=Count('comments',distinct=True))
initial qs 12 time 39ms
final   qs 5  time 24ms 
Осталось непонятным, почему с использованием Idea .save()/ser-er update у меня не получилось 
реализовать функ-л юзер removes file on front |=> on aws 3 (via dj-storages) img gets deleted
from bucket; same for replacing with a new one.
Final solution: in .save() ser-er Idea: if thumbnal attr|=> delete it
(front brings thumbnal == empty string if files is removed/not attached in form)
